# DOM II - Event Exploration

  

Fun Bus wants you to make their site more interactive. They are relying on you to provide 10 unique events to enhance their site. Explore the many events available to you by using the [MDN events reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events).




## Task 3: Create Unique Event Listeners

* [ ] Using your [index.js file](js/index.js), create 10 [unique event listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events). using your creativity to make the Fun Bus site more interactive.  Here are some unique events you could try to use: 
	* [ ] `mouseover`
	* [ ] `keydown`
	* [ ] `wheel`
	* [ ] `drag / drop`
	* [ ] `load`
	* [ ] `focus`
	* [ ] `resize`
	* [ ] `scroll`
	* [ ] `select`
	* [ ] `dblclick`

Using the 10 unique events, find ways to update the DOM in creative ways. For example you could change colors, animate objects, remove objects, etc.

* [ ] Nest two similar events somewhere in the site and prevent the event propagation properly
* [ ] Stop the navigation from items from refreshing the page by using `preventDefault()`

## Stretch Task:

* [ ] Go look at [GSAP](https://greensock.com/) and implement the animations found in that library with your custom events.
